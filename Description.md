#Rowan White's ACM Research coding challenge (Spring 2023)
My goal was to visualize the correlation between each property, find and pick with a high correlation to Star Type, then train two machine learning models and find their accuracy. One model will be trained to predict the Star Type using the two high correlation properties while the other will be trained to predict the Star Type using all properties besides Star Type. The goal is to see whether the extra data will make the model more or less accurate.
